				" When I was in elementary school, I wanted to become an <span class="light_blue">astronaut</span>.

				I lived in a province where there was no entertainment,

				Later he moved to study in Tokyo, where he remained working as an employee of Minori.
				For 5 years of work there Shinkai showed himself as a very versatile personality:
				he participated in the creation of new video game exhibitions,

					Some months later in June 2000, Shinkai was inspired to begin Voices of a Distant Star by drawing a picture of a girl in a cockpit grasping a cell phone. Some time later, he was contacted by Mangazoo, who offered to "work with him," giving him a grant to turn his idea into an anime they could sell. In May 2001, he quit his job at Falcom and began to work on Voices. In an interview, Shinkai noted that production took around seven months of "real work."

					"I'm often asked why I don't make feature films, 
					<br>but animation is something that allows you to do <span class="light_blue">everything yourself, as you planned</span>."

				<p class="works_article-text">
					In 2002 he released <span class="light_blue">The Voices of a Distant Star (Hoshi no Koe)</span>, which became his first short movie shown in theaters. Since both movies were made almost all by himself, their high quality surprised the viewers.

					<br>Characters in the new tape compared to previous experiences significantly increased,
					there are side characters in the film. The team of developers was also replenished.
					<br>In addition to Shinkai himself, Illustrator <span class="light_blue">Ushio Tazawa</span> (character design) 
					and Z-modeller <span class="light_blue">Kazuno-ri Takada</span> (Vellasela aircraft design) worked on the creation of the film.
					<br>But most of the work, true to his principle, the author took over.
					<br>The main thematic priorities in the new film remain unchanged: 
					<br><span class="light_blue">falling in love</span>, <span class="light_blue">growing up</span>, <span class="light_blue">choosing the path</span> and, of course, <span class="light_blue">loneliness</span>.
